          The Technology Student Association (TSA) is a national, non-profit
          career and technical student organization (CTSO) of middle school and
          high school students who are engaged in STEM (science, technology,
          engineering, and mathematics). Since TSA was chartered in 1978, over
          5,000,000 student members have participated through competitions,
          intracurricular activities, leadership opportunities, community
          service, and more.

          TSA chapters take the study of STEM beyond the classroom and give
          students the chance to pursue academic challenges among friends with
          similar goals and interests. Together, TSA chapter members work on
          competitive events, learn and apply leadership skills, and may attend
          conferences at the state, regional, and national levels. TSA chapters
          also are committed to a national service project and are among the
          most service-oriented groups in the community. TSA members may become
          officers within their state and then run for national office. To learn
          how to start a TSA chapter, call 703-860-9000 or join TSA.

          Imagine an activity so captivating that your students spend hours
          working on it for weeks at a time. That is what can happen when TSA
          members engage in TSA competitions. Only TSA members have the
          opportunity to compete at exciting state conferences and then at the
          annual National TSA Conference. Expert judging by technology and
          engineering educators and industry representatives inspires the best
          from participants. Members are rewarded not only with medals or
          trophies, but also with memories of the camaraderie and the challenge
          of participating in a National TSA Conference.
